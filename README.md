# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews to Enhance Customer Experience and Optimize Operations

## Project Overview:

Dataset: train.json, test.json, and val.json

Restaurant dataset that comprises 8,879 reviews of a single restaurant. These reviews are categorized into eight distinct aspects: food, service, staff, price, ambience, menu, place, and miscellaneous.

Sentiment analysis is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) and text mining that involves analyzing and determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text. The goal is to understand the feelings, opinions, or attitudes conveyed by the text, whether it's positive, negative, neutral, or even more specific emotions like anger, joy, or sadness.

## Objectives:

Sentiment analysis in this restaurant review dataset involves analyzing customer reviews to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. By examining key aspects like food, service, staff, ambiance, and price, the project aims to uncover customer experiences and identify areas for improvement. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help optimize restaurant operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall performance. With these insights, the restaurant can refine its strategies, improve service quality, and ultimately boost customer loyalty.

## Project Structure:

1. Text Preprocessing & Data Preparation:
- Clean the review data by removing noise such as special characters, stop words, and any irrelevant information to prepare the text for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform some basic analysis and visualizations to get an overall understanding of the data, looking at trends and patterns.

3. Train the Model (LSTM with Attention):
- Train the LSTM model with an attention mechanism to highlight the important words related to the review's aspects and sentiment.

4. Apply the Model & Generate Insights:
- Use the trained model on the dataset to make predictions. Then, analyze the new dataset by visualizing the results to gain insights and understand the overall sentiment.
