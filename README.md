## Overview

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews to uncover customer experiences and identify areas for improvement. The dataset consists of 8,879 reviews for a single restaurant, covering eight key aspects: food, service, staff, price, ambience, menu, place, and miscellaneous. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in these reviews, this project provides actionable insights that can help optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately improve overall restaurant performance.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this analysis is composed of three files: [train.json](data/train.json), [test.json](data/test.json), and [val.json](data/val.json).
- These files contain a total of 8,879 reviews for a single restaurant.
- Each review is categorized into one of the following eight aspects: food, service, staff, price, ambience, menu, place, and miscellaneous. The sentiment associated with each review is classified as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Objective

Sentiment analysis in this restaurant review dataset involves analyzing customer reviews to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. By examining key aspects like food, service, staff, ambiance, and price, the project aims to uncover customer experiences and identify areas for improvement. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help optimize restaurant operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall performance. With these insights, the restaurant can refine its strategies, improve service quality, and ultimately boost customer loyalty.

## Analysis Approach
1. Text Preprocessing & Data Preparation:
  - The first step involves cleaning the review data by removing noise such as special characters, stop words, and irrelevant information. This ensures the text is ready for analysis. Additionally, Word2Vec Skipgram embeddings are applied as discovered in the "Optimizing Sentiment Analysis Models for Accurate Predictions" project.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Basic visualizations and analysis are performed to understand the trends and patterns in the data.
3. Model Training (LSTM with Attention):
  - The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with an attention mechanism is trained. This model helps highlight the important words related to each reviewâ€™s aspects and sentiment, enhancing prediction accuracy.
4. Apply the Model & Generate Insights:
  - The trained model is applied to predict sentiment in the reviews. Insights are then drawn by visualizing sentiment distribution and identifying key sentiment drivers in the restaurant experience.
5. Recommendation:
- Based on the insights generated, actionable recommendations are provided to improve the restaurant's customer experience and business strategies.

## Key Findings
- Food: Positive feedback on quality, but concerns over price and temperature. Word clouds help identify areas for improvement, like consistency.
- Staff: 67% negative reviews, mainly about rudeness and wait times. Word clouds can guide staff training and service improvements.
- Miscellaneous: Neutral reviews with some complaints about seating and portion sizes. Word clouds can help optimize these aspects.
- Service: 51% negative reviews, focusing on slow service and poor behavior. Word clouds highlight areas to improve service speed and staff training.

## How to run code
1. Install Required Libraries: Ensure all necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, and gensim are installed like in the [file](SentimentAnalysis_RestaurantReview.ipynb)
2. Load the Dataset: Import the dataset by loading the train.json, test.json, and val.json files.
3. Run the Analysis Notebooks: Execute the analysis notebooks in Jupyter to process the data, build and train the model, and visualize the results.

Run this process in Google Colab for easy execution and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- Python Code: Data processing and analysis were done in Python using libraries like pandas and numpy for data manipulation, gensim for Word2Vec and FastText embeddings, and nltk for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming. Model evaluation was carried out with scikit-learn, and deep learning models were built and trained using torch.

- Visualization: For visualizing the results, matplotlib and seaborn were used for plotting, while wordcloud was utilized to generate word clouds to illustrate sentiment and aspect-wise insights.

Figure 2: Sentiment Distribution Across Aspects

Finding: Food got pretty good review, since there are only around 11% for negative reviews, the rest are neutral and positive. However, the most noticable aspects are staff and service aspects since these two have high negative reviews (67% and 51% respectively)
